## Description :
This project is a web application built with Flask that provides functionality to generate Java unit tests using two pre-trained models: `PLBART` and `SANTACODER`. It allows users to input Java methods and receive corresponding unit tests generated by the models. The application also includes features for reformatting Java code to improve readability.

## Models :
The application provides users with the choice of utilizing two specialized models that have been fine-tuned using approximately 1000 examples of Java code paired with their corresponding tests:

**PLBART**: This Seq2Seq model, detailed in its paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06333), is optimized for tasks involving code-to-text, text-to-code, and code-to-code transformations.
**SANTACODER**: Detailed in its paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03988), this model is a causal language model capable of performing code generation tasks as well.

## Application structure :
The application is built using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python.
The root route (/) renders a home page where users can interact with the application.
Two main routes handle the core functionality:
- `/download_model`: Loads the specified pre-trained models (PLBART and/or SANTACODER).
- `/generate`: Generates Java unit tests based on the provided input method and selected models.
For inference task, the application checks for the availability of a GPU and uses it if available, otherwise, it falls back to CPU.

## Installation

1. (Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   
**On Windows (cmd):**
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
**On Windows (Powershell):**
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```
**On macOS and Linux:**
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/eddahmany/Java_Unit_Test_Generator.git
   cd Java_Unit_Test_Generator
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

2. Access the application in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

N.B : Because of their large size, it is highly advisable to utilize a GPU for inference, especially when working with the Santacoder model.
